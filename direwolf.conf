# First you need to specify the name of a Tier 2 server.
# The current preferred way is to use one of these regional rotate addresses:
#     noam.aprs2.net           - for North America
#     soam.aprs2.net          - for South America
#     euro.aprs2.net          - for Europe and Africa
#     asia.aprs2.net           - for Asia
#     aunz.aprs2.net          - for Oceania

IGSERVER noam.aprs2.net

# You also need to specify your login name and passcode.
# Contact the author if you cant figure out how to generate the passcode.

# Some might want to send an IGate client position directly to a server
# without sending it over the air and relying on someone else to
# forward it to an IGate server.  This is done by using sendto=IG rather
# than a radio channel number. Overlay R for receive only, T for two way.

#PBEACON sendto=IG delay=0:30 every=10 symbol="igate" overlay=R lat=0.0 long=0.0 comment=DireWolf+RTL-SDR

# You might want to apply a filter for what packets will be obtained from the server.
# Read about filters here:  http://www.aprs-is.net/javAPRSFilter.aspx

# Thats all you need for a receive only IGate which relays
# messages from the local radio channel to the global servers.
