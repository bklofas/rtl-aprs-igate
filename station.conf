# Device Index / Serial
#    If using a single RTLSDR, set this value to 0
#    If using multiple SDRs, you MUST allocate each SDR a unique serial number using rtl_eeprom
#    The serial number must NOT be 00000000 or 00000001, as this causes big confusion to the rtl utilities.
#    i.e. to set the serial number of a (single) connected RTLSDR: rtl_eeprom -s 00000002

# SDR Gain Setting
#    Gain settings can generally range between 0dB and 40dB depending on the tuner in use.
#    Run rtl_test to confirm what gain settings are available, or use a value of -1 to use hardware automatic gain control (AGC).
#    Note that this is an overall gain value, not an individual mixer/tuner gain. This is a limitation of the rtl_power/rtl_fm utils.
gain = -1
